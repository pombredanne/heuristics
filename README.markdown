Heuristics
==========

Heuristics help us solve, or come close to solving, difficult problems. They are particularly powerful when tackling difficult problems in computer science, e.g., [the Traveling Salesman Problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem). My heuristics project contains my solutions to puzzles and problems presented in [my graduate class at NYU](http://www.cs.nyu.edu/courses/fall10/G22.2965-001/) in Fall 2010.
