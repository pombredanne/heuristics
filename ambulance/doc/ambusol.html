Tyler Neylon's solution:


Hi,
  I've verified the output of my program, which appears to be correct 
with a score of 26.  In some cases, the patient is dropped off and runs 
out of time to live exactly after the ambulance is done with him or her 
(including pick-up and delivery delays).  I hope that is ok.
  Below is the output of the program -- the lists represent the order in 
which the ambulance goes to each place.  Nonnegative numbers are indices 
into the people list (same order as in the file tmp) and -1 indicates 
the hospital.

See you Tuesday!  (or the next Tuesday, for some)
  Tyler
