Euclidean distance or Euclidean metric is the "ordinary" distance between two points that one would measure with a ruler.

The Euclidean distance between points p and q is the length of the line segment . In Cartesian coordinates, if p = (p1, p2,..., pn) and q = (q1, q2,..., qn) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance from p to q is given by:

d(p, q) = √ (  sum of (pi - qi) ^ 2 over n from i = 1 )

In three dimensional space where each point represented by {x,y,z}

√ (Px – Qx)^2 + (Py – Qy)^2 + (Pz – Qz)^2
