 Running the game
##################

To load the game, type the following at the command prompt:

java -jar voronoi.jar

An optional port number can also be passed on the command line:

java -jar voronoi.jar 999

This will force the game to listen on TCP port 999 for connections from computer players. If no port is specified, the game will listen on port 20000.

If everything worked, you will see two windows: the main game and a score 
board.


######################
 Controlling the game
######################

1. Choose the settings you desire as far as human players, stones, and time limit. (do this first as during selection ports are closed and again reset)

2. Connect all computer players

3. Click on Start when ready

4. Reset, well, resets it. 


################################
 Using the sample player client
################################

If you would like to see a sample game played by the computer (using a
totally random strategy), a player client is included. It requires
Python 2.0+ in order to run. It is configured to connect to port 20000 on
the local host so if you are using a different setup for the game, you will 
have to modify the PORT and HOST variables at the top of the file.

Once you've got it set the way you need it, just run:

python voronoi-player.py

This will connect to the game and wait for it to start. You can connect up to
10 players currently this way. Once you've got 2 or more connected, hit Start and watch the fun!

You can also play against the computer this way by setting Human Players to 1
and connecting only a single instance of the client.
